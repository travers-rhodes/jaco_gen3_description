# jaco_gen3_description
A wrapper around kortex_description published by Kinova https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/tree/master/kortex_description, with customizations to allow for use of gazebo

NOTE: This package probably isn't necessary with the latest Kinova branch update (note that the link above doesn't link anywhere any more after the deletion of the ros_kortex master branch)
